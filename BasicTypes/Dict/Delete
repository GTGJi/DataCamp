del dict[key] # delete the key and value in a dictionary

# DOES NOT RAISE EXCEPTION WHEN NO KEY FOUND
dict.pop( , 'when no key found print this')

# Comprehension:
test_dict = {"Arushi" : 22, "Anuradha" : 21, "Mani" : 21, "Haritha" : 21}
new_dict = {key:val for key, val in test_dict.items() if key != 'Mani'}

The dictionary before performing remove is : {'Anuradha': 21, 'Haritha': 21, 'Arushi': 22, 'Mani': 21}
The dictionary after remove is : {'Anuradha': 21, 'Haritha': 21, 'Arushi': 22}
